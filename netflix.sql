-- SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS count

-- SELECT AVG(release_year) AS avg_release_year

-- using count function to return the number all items from the dataset with (*)
-- SELECT count(*) FROM shows;

-- using sum() function to check for distinct value from data set
-- SELECT SUM(duration) FROM shows;

-- Output: 5646
-- meaning that there are  5646 minutes from the dataset. However some of the movies are in series such as season 1, season 2 92 min, 120 min etc

-- to solve the problem inorder to get the total duration of min and season using conditional aggregation in sql
-- SELECT 
--     SUM(CASE 
--             WHEN LOCATE('season', duration) > 0 
--             THEN CAST(LEFT(duration, LOCATE(' ', duration) - 1) AS UNSIGNED)
